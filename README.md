# Bootstrap-Portfolio


This portfolio is an improvement on a previous project using only HTML and CSS grid concepts; this time I've implemented Bootstrap 4.6 components and additional styling in my CSS. Links contain a visually appealing hover effect that aligns with the color scheme of the portfolio, and the sections are clearly separated to include an About Me section, the skills I hope to learn in this course, examples of my work (with placeholder images), and a contact section.
